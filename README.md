# express_challenge


Objective is to add code which handles post requests to write json snippets to ```/db/db.json```. Should use path and fs modules to read and write json data in order to facillitate this. 

Test this using insomina, no HTML is needed. 


## See example below:

JSON on the left should appear in  ```/db/db.json``` upon post request. Server should send response indicating post request recieved

Example of db.json
```json
[
    {
        "title": "dgdgsdfgfdg",
        "id": 4324324324,
        "content": "432ja"
    }

    //additional JSON appended here
]
```
